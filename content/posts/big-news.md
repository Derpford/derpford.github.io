### I'm Moving!

Those of you who follow my twitter account might've noticed that I quit my job recently. Let me explain some more things about that.

First: I got a job. I'm not sure how many details I wanna give out at the moment, but the plan is I'm gonna go work for a startup/incubator type place. It'll be interesting, partly because I won't have the job security of working for a company that's already making big money, but also partly because they're doing some crazy shit. And I mean *crazy shit*. We're talking "change the way we do programming" plans here. Only time will tell if progress gets made on that, but the guys I'm gonna be working for have *also* expressed interest in helping me with gamedev, including offering to build a whole-ass engine for some of my crazier ideas.

Second: I didn't really get much done this week. I'm not *gonna* get a lot done this week either, because I'm gonna have someone coming in this Sunday to check out the apartment, and holy fuck I let this place *go*. I gotta spend some time cleaning up, which is also gonna be good for unwinding after the emotional/mental torture that I went through while trying to unfuck the warehouse I worked at. I'm gonna write a blogpost about that shit. It's gonna be so bad.

Third: I have money for the next couple months already. I would *appreciate* some more Patreon funds, but I'm good for now. Everything appears to be going to plan, so I'll be hopping off to Seattle in August. It's gonna be great.
