### I'm changing my blogpost schedule!
This is partly because I want to make sure I don't burn through all my blogpost ideas, and partly so that I can prepare for [that streaming thing](https://perfectly-spherical.com/posts/minecraft-lp.md) (Remember that? Feels like a while ago, right?).

From now on, I'm doing one post a week, on Tuesday. Stream days are TBD, because I need to coordinate with the rest of the people I'll be streaming with.

Oh, and I'll be getting back to Hellwave Roadkill devlogs Soon(tm). I've gotten sidetracked with a number of different projects--not just [that other prototype I've been working on](https://twitter.com/dan_breez/status/1441305240398032897), but also projects at my new job. I'll try to keep y'all posted.
