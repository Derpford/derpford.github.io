### Have you ever wanted to watch me, my new boss, and a bunch of other nerds play Minecraft?

No? Too bad. Announcing *The Perfectly Spherical LP*, a project in which I attempt to shepherd the people I now live with through my own insane modpack.

#### Be amazed by our incompetence!

#### Be shocked by the terrible monsters!

#### Watch in awe as I demonstrate exactly why I'm not a popular indie dev yet!

Coming soon to twitch. Look for an announcement on this blog and on my Twitter when everything's ready to go.
