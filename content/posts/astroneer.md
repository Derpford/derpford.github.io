### Astroneer is the only "survival" game I've genuinely enjoyed.

This is kind of a complicated statement, because there are some games that are *called* survival games which I don't consider to be survival games. For example, Valheim is considered a survival game, but to my knowledge, it has no starvation mechanic, which places it firmly in the action-RPG camp for me.

In order to be a survival game, a game must have some resource which the player needs in constant supply--food, water, et cetera. This is also the reason I *hate* most survival games.

### Grind is not interesting.

And most survival games, sadly, build grind into their entire design. Food must be hunted down or farmed--harvested--always an action that the player must partake in, no matter how time-consuming or banal. If there are interesting mechanics to work with, I can sort of deal with this; Vintage Story's soil mechanics, combined with the ability to create cellars and preserve foods, makes it far more about *planning* than merely finding enough soil, water, and animals. But even then, I typically play with a mod that adds trot lines and snares, because I'm more interested in planning ahead and creating meals than I am in the act of hunting. (It doesn't help that Vintage Story has Minecraft-ish combat--pre-1.8 combat, at that--and most animals are surprisingly dangerous.)

It gets worse with games like Unturned, where you're expected to manage a food meter, a water meter, a *sanitation* meter, *and* your healthbar--all while zombies besiege you on all sides. I've had decent runs in Unturned, but only because I found a building with a fenced-off backyard early on. And I appreciate the devotion to 'realism', but realism and interesting mechanics do not overlap perfectly, and it's important to start from a design that gives the player at least a *shot* at survival.

### Astroneer does it better.

Primarily by removing grind from the basic mechanics. You have two resources, oxygen and energy, and they are both available in infinite supply from very early in the game; the tricky part is that they are only available *if* you are connected to your starting habitat.

This creates an exploration-centric game, where you are *technically* still worried about survival, but don't have to care about running out of time--so long as you *do* care about where you are and what your infrastructure looks like. There's no need to constantly right-click on the oxygen machine to refill your oxygen tanks--your tethers do that for you, and you can craft tethers so cheaply that--once you've stockpiled a bit--you can start leaving chains of tethers across the landscape, making paths that can be followed to key resources and caves.

Astroneer does it *right* by shifting the focus from the *day-to-day* acts of survival to the *long-term* logistics of survival--of expansion. It never *feels* like a grind, because most of the resources you gather are going toward new, exciting things, and you're never really under pressure to build *anything*. Did you know that the game doesn't pause when you hit the menu button? I didn't *notice* for a while, because Astroneer is designed in such a way that as long as you're standing near your shelter, you're okay.

It helps that it doesn't bother with combat. So many survival games just slap combat into their game as an afterthought, with very few even bothering to add damage types or even meaningful differences in attack speed. Rarely, if ever, is survival game combat *good*--because its origin is in Minecraft's monsters, which are a resource drain *first* and an interesting fight *never*. So, rather smartly, Astroneer makes all of its health hazards *static objects*--plants. Each plant does something *different* to cause trouble, but A) they're all easily dug up from the soil and B) they have a clearly defined threat zone which does not change. You do not have to engage with the "combat" system, and if you do, it is over quickly and does not cost you anything but a bit of time.

In short, Astroneer *does not waste the player's time*. It doesn't demand repeated, menial tasks, nor does it spend time on a half-assed combat system. 

(I'll talk about the UI in a later post, because it deserves a post of its own.)
