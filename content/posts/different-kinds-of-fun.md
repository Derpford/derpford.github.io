### Fun.

It exists. Supposedly. People argue quite a lot about what it *is*. What counts as fun? What makes one game more fun than the other? Is any game 'fun', or is that just a thing people say when they can't come up with a reason the game is good?

I propose that the question we're asking is inherently wrong. Fun is not a scalar value. It's not a binary, fun or not-fun. It's not a thing that can actually be captured in a scale from 1 to 10.

Rather, there are many kinds of fun. Some of them are present at the same time as others. Sometimes a game focuses on one kind of fun, but has several; other times a game combines many kinds of fun seamlessly.
