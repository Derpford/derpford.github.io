### STOP MAKING SUCH HUGE GAMES. HOLY SHIT.
A little while ago, *Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart* launched. The folks announcing it were proud to say that they [got it done without crunch](https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/06/09/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-devs-are-celebrating-no-crunch-because-we-need-some-wholesome). They rolled the game out the door (to the tune of 70 dollars) without a single case of pushing their workers too hard to make up for a bad schedule.

And then people started complaining that tiny details were missing. A plant didn't animate when Ratchet walked through it. The mud didn't have footprints in it when Ratchet walked through it. The horror. The horror! Why are we paying ten bucks more for *THIS*!?

I swear to God, this shit drives me up the wall. The way people are talking about this--the way publishers are reacting to it--the demands everyone is making--it's all completely, utterly, horribly *backwards*. It's *wrong*. And, as is tradition on the Internet, I am going to argue very angrily about it, because Someone Is Wrong On The Internet and that's not acceptable.

The problem here is that we're solely focusing on how much content we should get for ~~60~~ 70 dollars. Every game has to provide 80+ hours of content, replayability, an award-winning story (for a certain definition of 'award' and 'winning') and all of this has to be pushing the bar *constantly* on graphical fidelity, gameplay, and how big the map is. *Not* making something the size of the fucking Titanic is unacceptable, because why would you pay 70 bucks for *LESS* game? *Not* handcrafting every single building in a 10km-square world map is insanity, because why would you pay 70 bucks for *LESS* game? *Not* having 200 copies of the exact same minigame scattered across that map is unthinkable, because why pay 70 bucks for *LESS GAME*?

The fact of the matter is that more content isn't the solution here. You are not gonna get enough content to justify that 70 dollar pricetag, not within any reasonable amount of time, not even with a hundreds-strong development team. The thing about adding content is that it isn't an additive process, it's a multiplicative process. You're not *just* throwing another bossfight or another level in there--you're also having to make sure that bossfight doesn't do anything that breaks when the player completes certain quests before it or after it, and that the level you're adding has entrances and exits in all the right places, and that you can't glitch through a wall in a weird spot by firing a gun at the wrong angle and completely bypass the boss fight. The more content your game has, the more interactions that new content will have with the stuff you've already added, and that means more shit to test. And, on top of that, big companies have gotten into the habit of ignoring their QA team, while overworking their dev team, because it's gotta be out by Christmas.

### 70 DOLLARS IS TOO MUCH. *60* DOLLARS IS TOO MUCH.
<aside class="large"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YJLTedM.jpeg"></aside>

The content discussion is missing something really, really important: The price is not a magic number. It does not *need* to be a 60 dollar game, or a 70 dollar game for that matter. It does not even need to be a 50 dollar game. *A complete and entertaining experience can be delivered for 20 dollars*.

Am I asking for something on the scale of *Cyberpunk 2077* or *Fallout 4* or *Witcher 3* for 20 bucks? Hell to the fuck no. But you shouldn't *have* to have that much content, and you shouldn't *have* to justify a 60 dollar pricetag, because you don't *have* to charge 60 bucks.

In fact, that much content can bite you in the ass in other ways, too.

### I DON'T *WANT* TO DUMP 80 HOURS INTO YOUR GAME.
I might be alone in this, but...when I hear a game has all this content in its main story, and all of this extra stuff, and so many things to do, I actually get turned *off*. First of all, I have a job, dude. I *can't* spend 80 hours just playing one game. That's 8 hours a day for 10 days! That's the amount of time most people spend at their *day job*! Some of us have lives outside of the game, you know.

It's possible to have a lot of bite-sized content--like how *Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker* and *Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days* had individual missions, breaking up the flow of the game in such a way that I could popcorn-effect my way through them--but that's *never* how big-budget studios do it. It's all open-world this and seamless-experience that, with an hour count inflated by a checklist of sidequests, encounters, and minigames that's longer than the main quest is. Frankly, I just get *tired* after a while. I stopped playing Cyberpunk about 20 hours in, and haven't touched it for a couple months--and that's a game that I *did* like. I haven't even *bothered* buying Skyrim, because what little I've played of it feels like a grindfest. Ultimately, I don't *want* to sink that much time into a single game, especially not when I don't know if I'll even like doing it.

Just make smaller games. Stop trying to inflate the value of your game with a monolithic hour count, and just focus on making a complete experience. Stop expanding your world map, and start making what's *already there* more interesting. I would rather pay 20 bucks for maybe 5 hours of content that I *actually enjoy and finish* than pay 60 bucks for 80 hours of content that I don't care about at all.
