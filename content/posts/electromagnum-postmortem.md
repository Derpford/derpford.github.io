### So I finished my 7DFPS entry.
You can pick it up [here](https://dawnbreez.itch.io/electromagnum). It's a little rough around the edges. I don't know if or when I'll do another pass on it, though there are some things I should fix (for instance, someone got stuck on the intro to the Heavy Bolt).

So what did I learn?

### Getting hit with an unexpected delay sucks.

Partway through my 7-day timer, I got sidetracked by some stuff I needed to help my housemates with. Between that and my sleep schedule inverting itself, I was dead tired for 2 days, right in the middle of my week--which left me scrambling to finish levels in the last 2 days of my time limit. (Technically I still had a couple days by the jam's timer, but I wanted to take the 7 day limit Seriously).

I still finished a total of 8 levels (9, counting Road to Machinehead, which has no puzzles in it). And I'm happy with how they turned out, honestly, though I'm sure I could have detailed them much more thoroughly had I spent more time on them. But the delay meant I was rushed, and I can't count on being able to churn out good levels when I'm rushed. 

On that note:

### Having some pre-planning helps, a *lot*.

My [last post](https://perfectly-spherical.com/posts/puzzle-design/) about Electromagnum went over the process I used to build the puzzles. And it turns out that was really quite useful! Having my verbs written down--enumerated, so that I could easily refer to the list--made it much easier to design levels, because I already know what kinds of things I could do with my mechanics. I didn't have to grope around blindly for the building blocks of my levels; I had a neatly-sorted list of all the parts I had in inventory. I think this is what made it possible for me to put out good-enough levels in a short period of time--I frontloaded the hard work.

I also noted that I added a playing piece--the Barrel. The decision to add that was made while I was writing down the list of verbs--and it was an important addition to the list.

### Show-Don't-Tell tutorials are hard.

I was incredibly proud to learn that at least one of the people who played ElectroMagnum really appreciated the little "a-ha!" moments and the way that I tried to teach mechanics through the environment.

I was slightly less proud to realize that it wasn't perfect. The fence in level 3, where you learn to use the Heavy Bolt, is a bit too high--and that led one player to try and smash it down. That geometry isn't destructible.

If I really wanted to, I could have introduced the fences in level 1 or 2, letting the player get used to the idea that they're solid. I think the real issue is that the fence is too high, though--I had noticed this in testing, but I'd gotten used to firing over it, and was busy trying to make everything else.

I need to figure out a process for this. I played it by ear this time, and it worked, but there *has* to be a way to consistently make a tutorial that doesn't have to put any text on the screen.

### I still have The Itch.

I've been thinking about what I'll do next. I want to go back to Hellwave Roadkill, but I'm nervous, and another arcadey doom mod would do me some good.
