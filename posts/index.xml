It&amp;rsquo;s mostly used in the first person shooter sphere, especially in games with many players running around the same map. Games with high TTK, like Halo, can feel forgiving&amp;ndash;or they can feel like they&amp;rsquo;re being played in slow-motion. Games with low TTK, like Counter-Strike, can be exciting and fast-paced&amp;ndash;or they can feel exceptionally difficult, like playing chess against a grandmaster.</description></item><item><title>Different Kinds of Fun</title><link>http://perfectly-spherical.tk/posts/different-kinds-of-fun/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 02:40:39 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://perfectly-spherical.tk/posts/different-kinds-of-fun/</guid><description>Fun. It exists. Supposedly. People argue quite a lot about what it is. What counts as fun? What makes one game more fun than the other? Is any game &amp;lsquo;fun&amp;rsquo;, or is that just a thing people say when they can&amp;rsquo;t come up with a reason the game is good?
I propose that the question we&amp;rsquo;re asking is inherently wrong. Fun is not a scalar value. It&amp;rsquo;s not a binary, fun or not-fun.</description></item></channel></rss>
